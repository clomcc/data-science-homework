    "The first question in the homework asks for an explanation of Principal Component Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle Component Analysis is a method for analyzing data which may have high correlation between the variables or a large number of variables relative to the number of observations. It takes the matrix of observations and makes a change of basis so that the data is written as linear combinations of orthogonal vectors. This is done by finding the eigenvectors, which are the vectors the remain unchanged (up to scaling) by the transformation. These vectors can then tell us about the relative importance of the different variables. The first vector is the principle component, and it tells us what the primary direction of the data is and thus how the variables tend to move together. From here we can see how large the effect of a particular variable is. Then further components help to narrow down the error given by the first component.  Some of the components may show up as having a small impact. This is an indication that there was redundancy in the data. It also allows us to compress our data into a smaller set. This is useful when working with a very large set of data, because we may be able to pare it down to a smaller amount which is easier to store or transmit.\n",
